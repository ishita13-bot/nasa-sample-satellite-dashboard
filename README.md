# NASA Sample Satellite Dashboard 🚀

This repository is based on NASA’s sample **Satellite Dashboard** project and extends it with **AWS cloud services**.  
The goal is to explore how open satellite data can be processed, stored, and visualized for research and educational use.  

## 🌍 Goals
- Experiment with open NASA Earth observation datasets.  
- Integrate AWS services (S3, Lambda, EC2) for storage and processing.  
- Build a visualization dashboard for satellite data insights.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- **data/** → Placeholder for datasets.  
- **scripts/** → Processing scripts (Python, shell, etc.).  
- **docs/** → Notes, design diagrams, and documentation.  

## 📌 Status
🛠️ Early draft – project setup done, starting with dataset ingestion and AWS pipeline design.
