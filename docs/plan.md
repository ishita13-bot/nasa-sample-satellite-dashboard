# Project Plan

## Goals
- Learn how satellite data flows from source → storage → visualization.
- Apply AWS services (S3, Lambda, EC2) to process and display open data.

## Tools
- NASA Open Data APIs
- AWS (free tier where possible)
- Python (for scripts)

## Timeline
- Week 1: Repo + project plan ✅
- Week 2: Ingest sample dataset
- Week 3: Create simple AWS pipeline
- Week 4: Visualization prototype

## Next steps (short term)
- Identify a public NASA dataset to ingest.
- Write a small script to download sample data into `data/`.
- Sketch the AWS pipeline (S3 → Lambda/EC2 → dashboard).
